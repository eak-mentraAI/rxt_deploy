# RXT Deploy Backend Implementation Epics

**Version:** 2.0 (Revised)
**Last Updated:** October 21, 2025
**Status:** Planning
**Aligned With:** PRD v2.0, microservice_arch.md, SPOT_shim.md

---

## Overview

This document tracks the implementation of the RXT Deploy backend platform. Each epic represents a major body of work that delivers a complete, deployable capability. Epics are organized by implementation phase and dependency order.

**Version 2.0 Updates:**
- Enforced adapter contract compliance with conformance tests
- Explicit event schema governance as blocking requirement
- Tighter MVP path focusing on SPOT first (8-10 weeks to working deploy)
- End-to-end idempotency and exactly-once semantics
- Multi-tenant isolation test requirements
- Operational readiness Go/No-Go gates per phase

**Progress Tracking:**
- ‚úÖ Complete
- üîÑ In Progress
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Blocked
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Deferred
- ‚¨ú Not Started

---

## Revised MVP Strategy

**Core Principle:** Get to "hello world deploy" on RXT SPOT in 8-10 weeks by:
1. Scoping out Build Service initially (use GitHub Actions for artifacts)
2. Focus on Orchestrator + SPOT Adapter + SPOT Networking
3. Minimal but complete: Edge/API, Identity, Registry, Webhooks (minimal), Secrets, OPA-lite, Audit

**SDDC Flex Adapters** are built in parallel or deferred to Phase 3.

### Epic 3.3: Domains Service ‚¨ú **[DEFERRED TO PHASE 4]**

**Status:** ‚è≠Ô∏è **Deferred - MVP uses Ingress hostnames without custom domains**

**Rationale:** Custom domain management adds complexity. MVP uses cluster-provided domains (e.g., `app-name.spot.rackspace.com`). Custom domains added in Phase 4.

---

### Epic 3.4: Notifications Service ‚¨ú **[DEFERRED TO PHASE 4]**

**Status:** ‚è≠Ô∏è **Deferred - Use basic email via SMTP for MVP**

**Rationale:** Build Slack/webhook integrations in Phase 5. MVP uses simple email notifications for deployment success/failure.

---

### Epic 3.5: Templates/Blueprints Service ‚¨ú **[DEFERRED TO PHASE 4]**

**Status:** ‚è≠Ô∏è **Deferred - MVP uses manual deploy.yaml authoring**

**Rationale:** Templates reduce time-to-value but aren't blocking for MVP. Add golden templates in Phase 4.

---

## Revised MVP Critical Path (8-10 Weeks)

**Goal:** Working deploy to RXT SPOT with minimal but complete feature set

### Month 1 (Weeks 1-4): Foundation
1. Epic 1.1: Infrastructure
2. Epic 1.2: Event Bus with schema governance
3. Epic 1.3: Identity (defer SSO)
4. Epic 1.4: API Gateway with idempotency
5. **Spike:** Authenticate to SPOT, create namespace, get kubeconfig, verify `kubectl get nodes`

### Month 2 (Weeks 5-8): Platform Core
6. Epic 1.5: Project Registry
7. Epic 1.6: Webhooks (GitHub only)
8. Epic 2.1: Provider Router & Contracts
9. Epic 2.3: Orchestrator with deploy workflow only
10. Epic 2.7: SPOT Adapter
11. Epic 2.8: SPOT Networking
12. **Use GitHub Actions** for builds (no Build Service yet)

### Month 3 (Weeks 9-12): Ops Readiness
13. Epic 1.7: Secrets
14. Epic 1.8: Audit Log
15. Epic 2.2: Placement (rules-based)
16. Epic 2.9: Policy (OPA-lite)
17. Epic 3.1: Observability with golden dashboards
18. Epic 3.2: Usage (SPOT estimation only)

**Deliverable:** Push code ‚Üí GitHub Actions builds image ‚Üí Webhook triggers RXT Deploy ‚Üí Orchestrator provisions SPOT namespace ‚Üí Deploys pod ‚Üí Configures Ingress with TLS ‚Üí Returns URL

---

## Testing Strategy

### Contract Tests
- **Provider conformance suite** runs against SPOT (and eventually SDDC) adapter
- Tests run in CI against sandbox cluster
- Golden test fixtures for all `IComputePlatform` methods

### Chaos Tests
- **Multi-tenant isolation**: Parallel deploys across 10 tenants, verify no cross-contamination
- **Noisy neighbor**: One tenant consumes max quota, verify others unaffected
- **Orchestrator failure**: Kill orchestrator mid-deploy, verify resume after restart
- **Event bus partition**: Simulate NATS partition, verify DLQ and replay

### Security Tests
- **Tenancy isolation suite**: Token swapping attempts blocked, RBAC bypass attempts blocked, cross-namespace K8s access blocked
- **Secrets audit**: Verify all secret access logged
- **Network policy enforcement**: Pod A in tenant 1 cannot reach pod B in tenant 2

### Performance Tests
- **Sustained deploy throughput**: 50 concurrent deployments with <2% failures
- **Time-to-ready**: p95 < 10 minutes from webhook to healthy pod
- **API latency**: p95 < 250ms under 1k RPS

## Operational Readiness Gates (Go/No-Go per Phase)

### Phase 1 Gate (Foundation)
- [ ] All control plane services healthy and monitored
- [ ] Event schema registry enforcing validation
- [ ] Multi-tenant isolation verified via chaos tests
- [ ] Idempotency working end-to-end (edge ‚Üí services)
- [ ] Runbooks documented for top 5 infrastructure scenarios

### Phase 2 Gate (Platform Core)
- [ ] Provider conformance suite passing for SPOT adapter
- [ ] End-to-end deploy working (code ‚Üí webhook ‚Üí deploy ‚Üí URL)
- [ ] Saga compensation tested (rollback on failure)
- [ ] Network policies enforced (cross-tenant isolation verified)
- [ ] Synthetic deploy monitored and alerting

### Phase 3 Gate (Ops Readiness)
- [ ] Golden dashboards showing all service metrics
- [ ] On-call rotation established with runbooks
- [ ] Policy violations blocking non-compliant deploys
- [ ] Usage data accurate within 2% of SPOT provider
- [ ] Audit log integrity verified (hash chains)

---

## Documentation & Developer Experience

**Required Deliverables:**
- [ ] **OpenAPI** for Edge/API (all endpoints documented with examples)
- [ ] **AsyncAPI** for event bus (all event schemas versioned)
- [ ] **provider.yaml** spec documented with examples
- [ ] **Postman collection** for MVP SPOT path (end-to-end flow)
- [ ] **Sample app** with deploy.yaml demonstrating placement hints and policy evaluation
- [ ] **Runbooks** for top 10 operational scenarios

## Updated Risk Register

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| vCenter/NSX API instability | High | Deferred to Phase 3; SPOT first reduces risk |
| Kubernetes version compatibility | Medium | Test against K8s 1.25-1.29; use stable APIs only |
| Event bus message loss | High | DLQ, replay, idempotent consumers, monitoring |
| Platform adapter performance | Medium | Load tests, caching, parallel operations |
| Cost tracking accuracy | High | Reconciliation jobs (2% threshold), audit trails |
| Multi-tenancy data leaks | **Critical** | RLS, chaos tests, security tests, penetration tests |
| **Adapter drift** | Medium | **Conformance suite** catches divergence in CI |
| **Price signal volatility (SPOT)** | Medium | **Cache + percentile-based guardrails** |
| **Auth token sprawl** | High | **Vault broker + short-lived tokens only** |

## Success Criteria

**Technical:**
- [ ] Deploy to RXT SPOT from unified manifest
- [ ] <10 min environment creation time (p95)
- [ ] <2% deployment failure rate (after retries)
- [ ] 99.9% API uptime
- [ ] Usage accuracy within 2% of provider data
